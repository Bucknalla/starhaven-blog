Star Haven is a [Beneteau Oceanis Clipper 393](https://www.beneteau.com/en-us/oceanis-1995-2008/oceanis-clipper-393), built in 2002. She's a 39ft cruising yacht with a fin keel and a spade rudder; sloop rigged with a roller furling genoa and a in-mast furling main. She's a fast and comfortable cruiser, with a spacious cockpit and a large saloon (Star Haven is a 3 cabin layout). She's a great boat for a couple or a small family to cruise in comfort and style.

We've added a few upgrades to her since we bought her, including a new diesel heater as well as new electricals including a solar arch, 460W of Solar Panels, a 3000VA Inverter-Charger as well as a heap of telemetry systems, such as a Starlink and 4G backup data. In addition to the major changes, we've added some comforts including new curtains and upholstery as well as custom carpets. We've also addressed a number of maintenance items, including a standing rigging service (trimmed in-mast furling bearings) and replacing a few seacocks and thru-hulls.
