Welcome to our blog! We're hoping to document our adventures on our Beneteau Oceanis Clipper 393, Star Haven. We purchased her in 2023 and have been working on her ever since. Not yet sure where our adventures with her will take us, but we're starting with the British Isles and working out the plan from there. We're planning to setting off from Brighton in June, firstly making our way westward to Cornwall and the Scilly Isles.

While we're certainly not experts, we're excited to share our experiences and learnings with you. We're planning to share technical tips, interesting anchorages as well as the exploration we get up to. We hope you enjoy following along!
