We\u0026rsquo;re hoping to document our adventures on our Beneteau Oceanis Clipper 393, Star Haven. We purchased her in 2023 and have been working on her ever since. Not yet sure where our adventures with her will take us, but we\u0026rsquo;re starting with the British Isles and working out the plan from there. We\u0026rsquo;re planning to setting off from Brighton in June, firstly making our way westward to Cornwall and the Scilly Isles.\nWhile we\u0026rsquo;re certainly not experts, we\u0026rsquo;re excited to share our experiences and learnings with you. We\u0026rsquo;re planning to share technical tips, interesting anchorages as well as the exploration we get up to. We hope you enjoy following along!\n","date":"14 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/multi-author/","section":"Posts","summary":"Welcome to our blog!","title":"Welcome!","type":"posts"},{"content":"This page content is now full-width.\n","date":"8 March 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/anchorages/","section":"Star Haven","summary":"This page content is now full-width.","title":"My landing page","type":"page"},{"content":"test\n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/map/","section":"Star Haven","summary":"test","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"Star Haven is a Beneteau Oceanis Clipper 393, built in 2002. She\u0026rsquo;s a 39ft cruising yacht with a fin keel and a spade rudder; sloop rigged with a roller furling genoa and a in-mast furling main. She\u0026rsquo;s a fast and comfortable cruiser, with a spacious cockpit and a large saloon (Star Haven is a 3 cabin layout). She\u0026rsquo;s a great boat for a couple or a small family to cruise in comfort and style.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve added a few upgrades to her since we bought her, including a new diesel heater as well as new electricals including a solar arch, 460W of Solar Panels, a 3000VA Inverter-Charger as well as a heap of telemetry systems, such as a Starlink and 4G backup data. In addition to the major changes, we\u0026rsquo;ve added some comforts including new curtains and upholstery as well as custom carpets. We\u0026rsquo;ve also addressed a number of maintenance items, including a standing rigging service (trimmed in-mast furling bearings) and replacing a few seacocks and thru-hulls.\n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/boat/","section":"Star Haven","summary":"Star Haven is a Beneteau Oceanis Clipper 393, built in 2002.","title":"SV Star Haven","type":"page"}]
